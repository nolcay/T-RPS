# Telnet Rock Paper Scissors
This is a simple rock paper scissors game I made using ruby. You start the server just by running the code.
To connect to the server, just use telnet, as this server has no client application. At the end of the game,
the game asks you if you want to share your score on twitter using the game account. You need to have an account for the game. It can be your own account.
For the twitter part to work, you need to enter the credentials in. I have replaced the credentials with examples for the sake of security.

Have fun!
